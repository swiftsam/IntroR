A Professional and Reproducible Report
========================================================

In this R Markdown report we are using sample data and meaningless analyses, but the results look great and they are entirely reproducible!

Tables are a common element in reports,  here's how to make one which looks nice
```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
print(xtable(CO2[1:15,]), type="html")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
