How to find answers and get help
========================================================

### Print out a cheat-sheet
* [cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf](cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)

### Use the documentation built into R

```{r}
help(lm)  # every function has detailed documentation which does have the answer (guaranteed) 
          # but may be hard to understand at first
          
??'linear model' # if you don't know what functions / packages are relevant, just search
```
* take an extra second and try to understand what the error is trying to tell you

### Great websites with examples
* [R Cookbook](http://wiki.stdout.org/rcookbook/)
* [UCLA Statistical Computing](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/R/)
* [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)
* [Our very own Jon Baron's finzi](http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/)

### Great online communities just waiting to answer your personal question
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) - programming community with tons of R experts
* [Cross-validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) - statistics community.  not for pure R programming questions, but good for statistics questions you're working on in R.

### Some of my favorite books
* [R Cookbook, Teetor](http://www.amazon.com/Cookbook-OReilly-Cookbooks-Paul-Teetor/dp/0596809158)  - library of concrete examples of things you will want to do
* [R in Action, Kabacoff](http://www.amazon.com/R-Action-Robert-Kabacoff/dp/1935182390) - balanced coverage of R topics 
* [The Art of R Programming, Matloff](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Programming-Statistical-Software-Design/dp/1593273843) - for thinking harder about how to be a good programmer using R
* [Intro Stats with R, Dalgaard](http://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Statistics-R-Computing/dp/0387790535) - a good (maybe decent) book to give someone learning stats who wants to do it in R
